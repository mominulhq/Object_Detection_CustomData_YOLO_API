# Object_Detection_CustomData_YOLO_API

Welcome to the Object Detection with Custom Data YOLO API Repository! This repository encompasses a custom dataset focused on Koala images, a pretrained YOLO model fine-tuned for Koala detection, and an upcoming API that will be added shortly.

    Dataset: The data in this repository consists of manually annotated Koala images using LabelImg, ensuring accuracy and relevance to the project's goals.

    Model: We provide a pretrained YOLO model specifically optimized for Koala detection. Feel free to explore and adapt it for your needs.

    API (Coming Soon): Stay tuned for the upcoming API, which will enhance the functionality and usability of this project.
