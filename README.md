# Object_Detection_CustomData_YOLO_API

Welcome to the Object Detection with Custom Data YOLO API Repository! This repository encompasses a custom dataset focused on Koala images, a pre-trained YOLO model fine-tuned for Koala detection, and an upcoming API that will be added shortly.

## Directory Structure

- **koala_image/**
  - `image_1.jpg`
  - `image_1.txt`
  - `image_2.jpg`
  - `image_2.txt`

- **backup/**
  - Trained model saved here
  - Trained weights (presumably)

- **cfg/**
  - Customized model of YOLO

## Description



### `koala_image`

This directory contains images of koalas along with corresponding text files.

- `image_1.jpg`: image 1.
- `image_1.txt`: Annotation file of  image 1.
- `image_2.jpg`: image 2.
- `image_2.txt`: Annotation file of  image 2.

### `backup`

This directory is intended for storing backups.

- Trained model saved here: Explanation of the trained model saved in this directory.
- Trained weights (presumably): Information about the trained weights.

### `cfg`

This directory holds the customized model configuration for YOLO.

- Customized model of YOLO: Explanation of the YOLO model and any customizations made.


## API (Coming Soon)

Stay tuned for the upcoming API, which will enhance the functionality and usability of this project.
