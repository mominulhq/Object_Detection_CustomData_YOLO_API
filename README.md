# Object_Detection_CustomData_YOLO_API

Welcome to the Object Detection with Custom Data YOLO API Repository! This repository encompasses a custom dataset focused on Koala images, a pre-trained YOLO model fine-tuned for Koala detection, and an upcoming API that will be added shortly.

koala_image: This folder likely contains the koala images that are used for training or testing in your object detection project.

backup: This folder appears to store backups, and you mentioned that trained weights are present here. Trained weights typically refer to the learned parameters of a model after it has been trained on a dataset. This folder might contain files related to model checkpoints, which can be used to resume training or for inference.

cfg: This folder might contain configuration files related to your object detection model. Configuration files often specify the architecture, hyperparameters, and other settings for the model. We provide a pre-trained YOLO model specifically optimized for Koala detection. Feel free to explore and adapt it for your needs.


API (Coming Soon): Stay tuned for the upcoming API, which will enhance the functionality and usability of this project.
